AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) is a fully-managed Kubernetes service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It allows users to run Kubernetes clusters on AWS without the need to manage the underlying infrastructure.
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system used for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. AWS EKS provides users with a managed Kubernetes control plane, which handles tasks such as scheduling, scaling, and updating the Kubernetes cluster.
Users can use AWS EKS to run their containerized applications in a scalable and highly available environment. AWS EKS integrates with other AWS services, such as Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), to provide users with a complete end-to-end solution for deploying and managing containerized applications.
To use AWS EKS, users need to create an Amazon EKS cluster, which includes the Kubernetes control plane and worker nodes. They can then deploy their applications using Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts. Users can also use tools such as kubectl or the AWS Management Console to manage their Kubernetes cluster and applications.
AWS EKS provides users with features such as automatic scaling, cluster upgrades, and security features such as encryption and identity and access management (IAM) integration. It also integrates with other AWS services to provide users with additional functionality, such as logging and monitoring.
